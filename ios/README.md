# Mobile Take Home Exercise

Create an app using Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android.

This app should serve as a single-screen Yelp! Listing for The Getty Center, in Los Angeles, CA. Use the Yelp! Fusion API (https://www.yelp.com/fusion) to display the following basic information:
1. Star rating
2. Total Reviews
3. Address
4. Phone
5. Website
6. Hours of Operation
7. Top 3 reviews OR top 3 photos (iOS: using a TableView OR CollectionView, Android: using a ListView OR RecyclerView)

## What weâ€™re looking for:
* Solid understanding of software development best practices.
* Thoughtful approach to architecture.
* Familiarity with native libraries and syntax.
* Handling of basic error conditions.
* Basic test coverage.
* Little or no bugs or crashes.
* A sense for intuitive and well-organized UI.

## Data Source
* https://www.yelp.com/fusion (free account required)
* URL to The Getty Center: https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/zRlDhJgcwXEphTUhMaCfyw

Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries you with to complete your app. However, do NOT use the Yelp! Client SDKs (like https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-ios). We want to see a direct interface to the Yelp! Fusion APIs.

We recognize that putting together a high quality project that demonstrates the full range of your skills takes time. We ask that you try to time limit your effort to 4 hours. You may take as much extra time as you wish to feel good about your work and add any additional features that you would make your project stand out.
